=====================

A simple android app to enable Google Location Report, Google Now and related functions in China.

*ROOT REQUIRED*

*I have found an issue about Google Maps and its satellite view, no matter which one is correct and the other must be wrong. If someone finds the way to solve it, please contact me or reply in issue #2*

There are two version of this app, the geneeral one is for the users only rooted and the xposed one is for the users have xposed framwork.

In general, I suggest to use the xposed one, it do more clearly and stable.
